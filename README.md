# AnalysisOfCRElements

A study on the salt stress characteristics in both monocot and Dicot plants were studied and it was found through various research papers that the Cis Regulatory Elements are very important in determining and expressing the genes responsible.

First part of the project was studying and collecting the data from various databases like the Tair databases and NCBI and some microarray data.

The next step was to pre process the collected data to find the motifs from the genes found responsible for the stress response. The motifs or CRE were collected from 1000bp upstream the gene sequence as they were the most influencial.

After processing the data and cleaning it, we found the frequency of every element present to find correlation between both the types of plants.
It was found that motifs which were expressed more often in the monocot plants were also expressed more in dicot plants.

Through this we collected the most frequent ones and were plotted using python to sow correlation between the frequency number and the position where they are most frequently expressed.

Further experiments have to be conducted on the most expressed motifs in the wet lab to determine if the data collected match with the experimental findings.

If the data collected and experimental data match, genetically modified crops can be developed easily which can adhere to extreme salinity and can live a longer life.
